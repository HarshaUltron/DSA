🧩 1. Two Pointers Pattern

Why: This is the most reused pattern in MAANG — used in arrays, strings, and linked lists.
When: Sorted array, find pair/triplet, remove duplicates, etc.

Concepts:

Move left/right pointers smartly to avoid O(n²)

Shrinking and expanding windows

Common Problems:

Pair Sum (sorted)

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Container With Most Water

3Sum / 4Sum / 3Sum Closest

Trapping Rain Water

Target: 10–12 questions

🔁 2. Sliding Window Pattern

Why: Used for “subarray” problems — max/min/average/count of something in a subarray.
When: Continuous subarray, fixed or variable size.

Concepts:

Maintain running window sum/frequency/count

Use two pointers to move window boundaries

Common Problems:

Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Minimum Window Substring

Fruit Into Baskets

Longest Subarray with Sum ≤ K

Target: 8–10 questions

📈 3. Prefix Sum / Difference Array Pattern

Why: Speeds up subarray sum queries from O(n²) → O(n).
When: You need quick sum or difference queries, range updates.

Concepts:

Cumulative sums

Using hashmap with prefixSum (for subarray sum equals K type)

Common Problems:

Subarray Sum Equals K

Continuous Subarray Sum (divisible by k)

Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)

Range Sum Queries

Target: 8–10 questions

🔍 4. Binary Search on Arrays

Why: MAANG loves binary search beyond “search element.” It’s used to optimize answers or find thresholds.
When: Sorted array, monotonic property, "find minimum/maximum satisfying condition."

Concepts:

Lower bound / Upper bound

Binary Search on answer space

Common Problems:

Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Peak Element / Mountain Array

Koko Eating Bananas (binary search on answer)

Aggressive Cows / Allocate Books (advanced pattern)

Target: 8–10 questions

⚙️ 5. Sorting + Greedy Combo

Why: A ton of array problems are solved by sorting + greedy logic.
When: You need minimal/maximal results (intervals, activities, etc.)

Concepts:

Sort by start/end, apply greedy picks

Common Problems:

Merge Intervals

Non-overlapping Intervals

Meeting Rooms / Minimum Platforms

Minimum Arrows to Burst Balloons

Target: 6–8 questions

💥 6. HashMap / Frequency / Counting Pattern

Why: Most optimal subarray and “find missing/duplicate” questions use this.
When: Counting, frequency, or lookup in O(1)

Concepts:

Counting occurrences

Detecting duplicates

Using hashmap with prefix/diff arrays

Common Problems:

Two Sum

Subarray Sum = K

Longest Consecutive Sequence

Majority Element

Top K Frequent Elements

Target: 8–10 questions

🔁 7. Cyclic Sort / In-Place Manipulation

Why: MAANG often asks “find missing/duplicate number” questions that rely on in-place rearrangement.

Common Problems:

Missing Number

Find All Duplicates in Array

First Missing Positive

Target: 4–5 questions

🧠 8. Matrix & Submatrix (Optional for Arrays block)

Why: Small pattern, but useful before moving to graphs.

Common Problems:

Rotate Matrix

Spiral Matrix

Set Matrix Zeroes

Target: 3–5 questions
